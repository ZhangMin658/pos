          <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Does my subscription automatically renew?</h3>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">The subscription is based on auto-renewal. You'll be charged each month/year until
            you disable it. If you do so, your account will remain upgraded until the end of the current prepaid period.

          <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Am I allowed to modify the item that I purchased?</h3>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">Yes. You can customize our items to fit the needs of your end product. Example:
            You could change the colors, text, and layout of a flyer template or convert an HTML template into a
            WordPress theme for a single client.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 text-left pr-4 mb-2">
          <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Can I store the item on an intranet so everyone has access?</h3>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">No, items must be stored in a location where only those who need them have access.
            If you purchased a single-use license, once the item has been used in a single end product, the only place
            you should store it is in the archive files for that end product.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12 text-left pr-4 mb-2">
          <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Is this item still 'royalty free'?</h3>
          <p class="font-weight-bold">Yes. Royalty free means you pay for the item once for each end product, and you
            don't need to pay any additional or ongoing fees for each person who sees or uses it. This is separate to
            whether you need a clearance from the owner of rights in the real world product or trademark within an item.
